## Review

GitHub Copilot had three comments, out of which two were mostly nitpicks.

Here were the three targets:

1. change method return type signature from `str | None` to `str`, since a method always
   returned a string.

2. remove an unused method.

3. Nitpick to rename a constant variable

In summary, Copilot pointed out pretty minor things. This is mostly due to the simple nature of the code itself.
All the changes proposed were valid and most were implemented.
